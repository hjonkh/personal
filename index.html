                <p>Hello! I am Tyler Halbur, a 3rd year COMS student at Iowa State. I enjoy working with computers, both physcially and digitally.
                    I often code in my free time, mostly for personal projects that let me learn more about a given topic or language.
                    I work at the ISU Surplus as an IT student, where we process all the computers the university acquires with federal funding.
                    Our main goal is data security, making sure sensitive university data doesn't make it outside the university, and then we sell
                    anything we can get working that we think people will want. Laptops, towers, servers, and loads of other stuff come through us.
                </p>

                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <img src="images/project1.png" alt="Fractal Viewer" style="width:25%">
                <img src="images/project2.png" alt="Fractal Viewer" style="width:25%">
                <h2>Fractal Viewer</h2>
                <p>Most of the projects to my name are currently personal and thus relatively small in both scale and scope.
                    One of my more polished small projects is a fractal viewer, allowing a user to zoom in on the famous Mandelbrot Set.
                    This project was done in a couple hundred lines of C code, and was a good excuse to learn a great many things, from OpenGL
                    to complex numbers in code to even CUDA to enable my GPU to do highly paralellizable work.
                </p>
                <h2>Chat Client</h2>
                <p>A small project of mine for a while was a chat client, done in Java for both the server and client. The main desire was
                    to see how feasbile an alternative to a webapp-based application was. I'd say from what I experienced, with some elbow grease
                    and a strong desire to see it through, it would be possible, however I lacked both of those, and as such it has been shelved for now.
                </p>
                <h2>Hotel Management Software</h2>
                <p>A slightly larger project for COMS 3620. It required collaboration with four other people, and was mainly used as a tool
                    to help us learn design patterns, principles of design, and how to work as a team for code projects. This was where I learned to
                    use Git.
                </p>
                <h2>Smartcheck.sh</h2>
                <p>This (currently) small project was done for one specific purpose at the Surplus: to gather the SMART data off of hard drives
                    so we could gauge how "healthy" they still were. Initially just meant to scrape useful data from SAS hard drives, it quickly
                    grew into a tool to scan most hard drives we could throw through it. This project is currently done with a Bash script.
